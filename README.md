# Learning-Python

I began learning Python online via EdX (https://www.edx.org/). I took PY0101EN, a course offered for free by IBM. The notebooks (labs) I used for the course are included in the PY0101EN folder. After taking the course, I began taking a course through UC Davis offered by Dr. Ian Korf. Those course materials are also in their respective folder.
